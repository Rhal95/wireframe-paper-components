# Wireframe Paper Components

Printable templates for wireframes. Print, cut, and arrange your wireframes however you want. 
The components are kept simple to allow full freedom when designing your screens.

## How-To

Print on A4 Paper. 
If available, use heavier paper than standard office paper. 80-120 gps is recommended.  
Cut apart using scissors or a crafting knife. A ruler helps when using a crafting knife.

Do not cut apart the radio-boxes, check-boxes, pagination component, and chips. 
Those are already spaced correctly and can be folded to hide components you don't need.

Print out or draw an outline for a screen. Build your wireframe by arranging the pieces on the paper screen. Add text, colors and custom components as you see fit. 

## Why?

1. I prefer handling physical objects.
2. I like crafting.
3. Arranging paper pieces allows for incremental improvements without wasting paper.
4. It is quicker than painting the same components all the time.
